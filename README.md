Developer 2: API Integration and Data Management

    Set Up API Calls
        Learn how to use fetch or Axios for making API requests.

    Fetch Posts from HackerNews API
        Implement the function to retrieve posts and handle responses.

    Store Data in State

Developer 3: Live Updates and Optimization

    Set Up Live Data Checking
        Implement a function using setInterval to check for new posts every 5 seconds.

    Throttling/Debouncing API Requests
        Implement a debounce function to limit how often API calls can be made.

    Optimize State Management
        Ensure efficient state updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

    Integrate Live Updates with UI
        Update the UI dynamically to reflect new posts or changes.

    Implement Notifications for New Data
        Create a simple alert or notification system to inform users of new posts.
